This folder includes end-to-end tests made with jest-puppeteer.
Each test should be run one by one with "npm test <test filename>"
Simultaneous tests won't work since they use the same URL with
different plugin settings.

A WordPress installation with WooCommerce and the plugin must be installed
in a local (or remote) testing enviroment, the URL of which needs to be added
to the config.js file (copy config-sample.js to config.js with proper settings).

The WordPress installation that is used for the PHPUnit test dependencies
can be used for the puppeteer tests as well.
